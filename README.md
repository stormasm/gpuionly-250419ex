This repo was created because the bp1 branch concept was not working for some reason
with the example code running in the same repo as gpui when the branch *bp1* was referenced
from the gpuiex repo.

So we got this repo working which does work.

This repo has the gpui code along with the examples that run standalone in this repo.

This repo also works with an examples repo lodged in another repo and *gpui* is referenced
here both locally and via github.
